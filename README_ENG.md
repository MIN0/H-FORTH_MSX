# H-FORTH_MSX

This is based on the H-FORTH site (see below), which is a FORTH language published by A. Hiramatsu in 1999.

Mr. Hiramatsu's last post on this site was in 1999, and his email contact information is no longer available. At my personal discretion, I have moved only the H-FORTH related files that were on the "H-FORTH page" to this page on GitHub. Therefore, it is unclear how long this page will remain. These H-FORTH related files were added to the original file on Mr. Hiramatsu's site, translated into English using Google Translate, and the examples in the file were converted into .4TH files. There are some parts where I have added some comments, but the original text is mostly the same.  
  
If you use H-FORTH, please read these files. In particular, README.txt contains important information such as copyright. Since you cannot contact Mr. Hiramatsu, you will use H-FORTH at your own risk. I, Minoru Kishi, who assisted Mr. Hiramatsu in preserving his records, is not responsible for anything that may result from this (including texts created with Google Translate).  
  
  
  
I have written a lot of things, but please enjoy Mr. Hiramatsu's humorous writings about H-FORTH. There are many things you can enjoy using MSX, such as the graphic screen and music-related operations. Although it is said to be a language for maniacs, I think it would be great if MSX could be enjoyed by playing around with H-FORTH.
